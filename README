About
-----

This module provides a Perl interface to the Enlightened Sound Daemon,
which is used on many GNU/Linux systems to mix sound output streams
from multiple desktop applications.  It allows you to open input,
output, monitoring, and filtering streams which function like normal
Perl filehandles, as well as to control various parameters on the ESD
server.

Installation
------------

In general, the following sequence of commands should be fine:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

Note, however, that the test suite will fail if ESD is not running on
your machine.  The last two tests also seem to fail on some versions
of ESD in some configurations, though I haven't investigated why at
the moment.

Please send other reports on installation or test failure to the
address at the top of this file.
